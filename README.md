5. Saving dumps
Sometimes, you may want to save dumps for analysis later.  Maybe itâ€™s on a non-development machine or you want to collect several dumps. You can configure Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 to always generate and save a dump file.

Create a key named: HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps
Dumps will default to the following directory: %LOCALAPPDATA%\CrashDumps
You can override the default with a DumpFolder value (REG_EXPAND_SZ)
You can also limit the number of dumps saved with a DumpCount value (DWORD)
